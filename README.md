## Project Scientist

### Introduction
With AI snowballing due to the recently found applications of Large Language Models, it's about time to show the world where the shortcomings of LLMs are and provide the world with an actually intelligent AI, and not a regurgitator.

### Details
Wouldn’t you like to know, this is just a prompt, but I’ve been working on this already for a while now, pretty cool stuff though! For the sake of this project, I’ll at least say it’s an AI based on creating sound logic by making its own test conditions in code. 

Parts to work on would be the

- Environment
- Model’s algorithm
- Pruning of algorithm selection

The code should be useful and cool
